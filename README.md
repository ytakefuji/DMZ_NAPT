# DMZ_IPmasquerade
DMZ(demilitarized zone) and IP masquerade (NAPT: Network Address Port Translation) 
are WAN-to-LAN and LAN-to-WAN services.

DMZ translates a single WAN IP server to a single LAN IP server.

IP masquerade or NAPT maps a single WAN IP with several ports 
to multiple LAN servers with ports.
